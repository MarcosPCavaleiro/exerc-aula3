            Oh, yeah <br>
            I feel you crumble in my arms down to your heart of stone  <br>
            You bled me dry just like the tears you never show  <br>
            Why don't you take what you want from me?  <br>
            Take what you need from me <br>
            Take what you want and go <br>
            Why don't you take what you want from me? <br>
            Take what you need from me <br>
            Take what you want and go <br>
            I never needed anything from you <br>
            And all I ever asked was for the truth <br>
            You showed your tongue and it was forked in two <br>
            Your venom was lethal, I almost believed you <br>
            Yeah, you preyed on my every mistake <br>
            Waited on me to break, held me under hopin' I would drown <br>
            Like a plague, I was wasting away <br>
            Tryna find my way out, find my way out <br>
            And it finally came the day <br>
            I start giving my heart away <br>
            For Heaven's sakes, my bones will break <br>
            But you never own my soul, no <br>
            I feel you crumble in my arms down to your heart of stone <br>
            You bled me dry just like the tears you never show <br>
            Why don't you take what you want from me? <br>
            Take what you need from me <br>
            Take what you want and go <br>
            Why don't you take what you want from me? <br>
            Take what you need from me <br>
            Take what you want and go <br>
            I took them stones you threw, made chains for the crew (ice) <br>
            I brought up 10 hoes, this coupe only made for two (yes, sir) <br>
            They all ran through it, it ain't nothing left to do <br>
            I need some more reasons to live out this evening (straight up) <br>
            I've been sippin' forever and just taking whatever <br>
            Hoping, thinking whenever you'll be back around <br>
            Let's go our ways, whichever <br>
            You say how is however long <br>
            'Cause you know I'll never be alone <br>
            Love (love, yeah) <br>
            Shorty gon' back <br>
            Need it on sight <br>
            Crack it all back <br>
            Give her that pipe <br>
            All of my gang <br>
            Shawty went bad <br>
            I feel you crumble in my arms down to your heart of stone <br>
            You bled me dry just like the tears you never show <br>
            Why don't you take what you want from me <br>
            Take what you need from me <br>
            Take what you want and go <br>
            Why don't you take what you want from me <br>
            Take what you need from me <br>
            Take what you want and go <br>
            Take it all away <br>
            Why don't you (take what you want, take what you need) <br>
            Take what you need from me, yeah <br>
            (Take what you want) why don't you (take what you need?) <br>
            (What you need, yeah) <br>
